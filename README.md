# PreProcessing-
Bio-signal EEG Pre-processing Using MatLab and EEGLAB(method)

This is a repository created to practice EEG preprocessing. 
So it may not be accurate in processing the data. 
I hope you will share useful information with me, and let us know if something is wrong.

I proceed process as below 
<Process>
1) Loading a EEG data: I used data proposed in EEGLAB
2) Filter : Bandpass
3) Epoch  : related my research  
4) Averaging
5) Baseline remove : [-1, 0] remove
6) ICA(Independent Component Analysis)
  
thank you
